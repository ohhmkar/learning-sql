### Database normalization

Database normalization is useful because it minimizes duplicate data in any single table, and allows for data in the database to grow independently of each other (ie. Types of car engines can grow independent of each type of car). As a trade-off, queries get slightly more complex since they have to be able to find data from different parts of the database, andperformance issues can arise when working with many large tables.

### Multi-table queries with JOINs

Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a primary key that identifies that entity uniquely across the database. One common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient), but it can also be a string, hashed value, so long as it is unique.

Using the JOIN clause in a query, we can combine row data across two separate tables using this unique key. The first of the joins that we will introduce is the INNER JOIN.

```SQL
--- Select query with INNER JOIN on multiple tables
SELECT column, another_table_column, …
FROM mytable
INNER JOIN another_table
    ON mytable.id = another_table.id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

##

### Asymmetrical Data

If the two tables have asymmetric data, which can easily happen when data is entered in different stages, then we would have to use a LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN instead to ensure that the data you need is not left out of the results.

```SQL
--- Select query with LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOINs on multiple tables
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table
    ON mytable.id = another_table.matching_id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

Like the `INNER JOIN` these three new joins have to specify which column to join the data on.

When joining table A to table B, a `LEFT JOIN` simply includes rows from A regardless of whether a matching row is found in B. The `RIGHT JOIN` is the same, but reversed, keeping rows in B regardless of whether a match is found in A. Finally, a `FULL JOIN` simply means that rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in the other table.

> [!NOTE]
> When using any of these new joins, you will likely have to write additional logic to deal with `NULL`s in the result and constraints (more on this in the next lesson).

> [!TIP]  
> **Did you know?**  
> You might see queries with these joins written as `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`, or `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but the `OUTER` keyword is really kept for SQL-92 compatibility and these queries are simply equivalent to `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN` respectively.
